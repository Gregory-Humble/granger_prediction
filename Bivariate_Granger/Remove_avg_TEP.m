% for each individual
% for each trial 
% for each data point in time (pnts) calulate the average voltage value across all trials 
% then subtract from that data point (pnts) for each indidivual trial

% loop across all trials for that same data point in time (pnts)

% loop over time (pnts)

% save output as new .MAT file
